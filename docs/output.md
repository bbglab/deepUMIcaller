## Mutations

Mutations VCF

(optional) Variant annotation

### Key role

- Provides a single-sample VCF with all the mutations detected in duplex reads.
- Filter flags (`low_mappability`, `low_complex_repetitive`, `nanoseq_snp`, `nanoseq_noise`, `n_rich`, `no_pileup_support`, ...) are annotated in the FILTER column of every record; no variant is discarded from the VCF, leaving filter decisions to the user (or to deepCSA downstream).
- For each mutation, four variant allele frequency (VAF) values can be computed:
  - **VAF_vd** — VAF as computed by VarDict at calling time.
  - **VAF** — duplex VAF: ALT duplex consensus reads / all duplex consensus reads at the position (recomputed from `samtools mpileup` over the duplex BAM).
  - **VAF_AM** — all-molecules VAF: ALT consensus reads (duplex + single-strand) / all consensus reads (recomputed from `samtools mpileup` over the all-molecules BAM).
  - **VAF_ND** — no-duplex VAF: ALT non-duplex reads / all non-duplex reads covering the position.
- Each record also carries the mean position in read and the standard deviation of this value. These values can be used to identify potential issues with the calling of certain variants.
- When `annotate_mutations=true`, an Ensembl VEP-annotated VCF is published under `annotation/`.

### Outputs

- mutations_vcf
- annotation (only when `annotate_mutations=true`)

## BAM files

### Key role

- BAM files are essential for the downstream analysis to compute the sequencing depth at each position.
- Having the `amfiltered` BAM file allows you to merge sequencing data from the same sample coming from different libraries and doing the calling together.

### Outputs

- sortbamduplexcons
- sortbamamfiltered

## Duplex QC metrics

Metrics to assess the quality of the duplex library prep.

### Key role

- MultiQC provides a summary of the several metrics computed in the pipeline and described here below.
- Family metrics plots are key to make decisions on the optimal sequencing based on the sample diversity.
- FASTQC is important for identifying preexisting problems in the sequencing data.
- QualiMap outputs basic coverage, on target percentage, and other metrics of the different aligned BAM files.
- Discarded coverage files provide a view on the regions of the genome where reads are being lost due to poor mapping.
- Compute depth contains the values of depth per position for each sample. (third column of the .tsv files)
- Coverage global includes a summary of the depth per each region in the global_exons_file provided in the pipeline, in this way there is a bit more useful information on the coverage per region.

## Basic mutations QC

### Key role

- Quickly assess the quality of the variants called in the duplex reads. Via simple checks such as the plot of position of the variant in th reads and the mutation frequencies per trinucleotide, you can quickly tell if the variants are occurring based on the expected mutational processes or it is enriched in artifacts. You can also compare the variant calls in purine vs pyrimidine sites and see if there is any obvious differences. No apparent differences a this point does not mean that mutations are all clean.

- cohortmutsperpos includes a representation of the enrichment of mutations at the beginning of the reads for each of the samples in the cohort and for each of the single base substitution types. It also includes a couple of tsv files showing which samples failed the QCs and what are the values of the ratio of mean number of mutations per position found in the first 5 (by default) positions of the read vs the rest of the read.

### Outputs

- cohortmutsperpos
- mutsperpos
- sigprofplot
- sigprofplotpur
- sigprofplotpyr

## Internal files

### Key role

- Each of the following files contains specific information of intermediate processings of the data.

### Outputs

- pipeline_info: compiles basic information of the nextflow run

- callingvardictduplex: contains all the outputs of the variant calling done by VarDict ([click here for more info](https://github.com/AstraZeneca-NGS/VarDictJava))

- createbed: each BED file contains a definition of the regions that have been sequenced in that sample.

- nsxposition: each file has 4 columns: chromosome, position, total_depth (including Ns), and N count.

- readjustregions: this directory contains BED files per sample with information on the regions surrounding mutation calls, targetted regions and others that are used internally for searching and recounting specific mutations. We include it as part of the output just in case it is useful.
